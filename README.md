"Seam Carving"- content-aware image rescaling program. Finds the seams of the image with the least "energy" (i.e importance to the image) and removes those to resize image to desired width and 
height. Consists of Martix and Image classes with a 255x255 'pixel' grid, each pixel consisting of three different values representing the rgb levels, as well as unit testing for these
classes.
